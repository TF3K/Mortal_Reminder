# 1.2 beta changes:

1) Added a new field `assignees` that displays the names of the task handlers
2) Revamped the logo for better visuals
3) Added new Options: `Edit a Task` and `Search for a task`

# Future Goals:

- Add MacOS support
- Create a GUI instead of a CLI
- Make the code modular (by that i mean not write everything in main lol, the thing is 500 lines already)
- Write a better Documentation
